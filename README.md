# Climb
The world is flooding, but the giant bean stalk grows ever upward. This game answers the question "What do we do now?" with a simple instruction. "Climb"! Play with up to three other players, and stay above the rising water for as long as you can. You have only your wits and a limited number of grappling ropes at your disposal, so choose your path up wisely. Work with or against the other players, the choice is yoursâ€”but remember that time is of the essence, and every second counts when it comes to escaping the flood. The bean stalk is procedurally generated, so each and every game is unique. How long can you survive?
